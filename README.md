Rails 4.1 Vagrant/Docker Base
======

This is a Rails 4.1.x installation base which utilizes Vagrant and Docker.

Vagrant is the virtualized development server which, in turn, sets up
Docker containers for:

* Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Redis

This was based upon work created by [TalkingQuickly](https://github.com/TalkingQuickly) and modified for my own needs.
